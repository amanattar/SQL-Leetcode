## Question

### Tables

#### `Trips` Table:
| Column Name | Type     | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`        | int      | Primary key for the table.                                                  |
| `client_id` | int      | Foreign key referring to `users_id` in the `Users` table (client).          |
| `driver_id` | int      | Foreign key referring to `users_id` in the `Users` table (driver).          |
| `city_id`   | int      | City ID where the trip occurred.                                            |
| `status`    | enum     | Status of the trip (`'completed'`, `'cancelled_by_driver'`, `'cancelled_by_client'`). |
| `request_at`| varchar  | Date when the trip was requested.                                           |

#### `Users` Table:
| Column Name | Type     | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `users_id`  | int      | Primary key for the table.                                                  |
| `banned`    | enum     | Whether the user is banned (`'Yes'` or `'No'`).                             |
| `role`      | enum     | Role of the user (`'client'`, `'driver'`, `'partner'`).                     |

## Problem Description
The goal is to compute the **Cancellation Rate** for unbanned users (both clients and drivers) on each day between `"2013-10-01"` and `"2013-10-03"`. The **Cancellation Rate** is calculated as:

$$
\text{Cancellation Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of cancelled requests}}{\text{Total number of requests}}
$$

---

## Solution

### SQL Query

```sql
SELECT 
    t.request_at AS Day,
    ROUND(SUM(status != 'completed') / COUNT(*), 2) AS 'Cancellation Rate'
FROM Trips t
    LEFT JOIN Users cli
        ON cli.users_id = t.client_id
    LEFT JOIN Users dri
        ON dri.users_id = t.driver_id
WHERE t.request_at BETWEEN "2013-10-01" AND "2013-10-03"
    AND cli.banned != 'Yes'
    AND dri.banned != 'Yes'
GROUP BY t.request_at;
```

# Explanation

**Table Joins:**

The Trips table is joined with the Users table twice:
- `cli` for client details (`client_id` → `users_id`).
- `dri` for driver details (`driver_id` → `users_id`).

**Filters:**

The query focuses on requests between "2013-10-01" and "2013-10-03".
- Only trips involving unbanned users (`cli.banned != 'Yes'` and `dri.banned != 'Yes'`) are considered.

**Cancellation Condition:**

The condition `status != 'completed'` identifies canceled trips (either by the driver or the client).

**Aggregation:**

- The `SUM(status != 'completed')` counts canceled trips for the day.
- The `COUNT(*)` computes the total number of trips for the day.
- The ratio of canceled trips to total trips is calculated and rounded to two decimal places.

**Grouping:**

The results are grouped by `request_at` to calculate the metrics for each day.
