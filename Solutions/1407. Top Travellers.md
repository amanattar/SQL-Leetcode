# 1407 Top Travellers

## Problem Description

**Leetcode Link:** [Top Travellers](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-travellers/description/)

**Table: Users**

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |

- `id` is the column with unique values for this table.
- `name` is the name of the user.

**Table: Rides**

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| user_id     | int     |
| distance    | int     |

- `id` is the column with unique values for this table.
- `user_id` is the id of the user who traveled the distance `distance`.

**Task:** Write a query to report the distance traveled by each user. Return the result table ordered by `travelled_distance` in descending order. If two or more users traveled the same distance, order them by their name in ascending order.

## Example

**Input:**

**Users Table:**

| id   | name      |
|------|-----------|
| 1    | Alice     |
| 2    | Bob       |
| 3    | Alex      |
| 4    | Donald    |
| 7    | Lee       |
| 13   | Jonathan  |
| 19   | Elvis     |

**Rides Table:**

| id   | user_id  | distance |
|------|----------|----------|
| 1    | 1        | 120      |
| 2    | 2        | 317      |
| 3    | 3        | 222      |
| 4    | 7        | 100      |
| 5    | 13       | 312      |
| 6    | 19       | 50       |
| 7    | 7        | 120      |
| 8    | 19       | 400      |
| 9    | 7        | 230      |

**Output:**

| name     | travelled_distance |
|----------|--------------------|
| Elvis    | 450                |
| Lee      | 450                |
| Bob      | 317                |
| Jonathan | 312                |
| Alex     | 222                |
| Alice    | 120                |
| Donald   | 0                  |

**Explanation:**  
- Elvis and Lee traveled 450 miles. Elvis is listed first because his name is alphabetically smaller than Lee.
- Bob, Jonathan, Alex, and Alice each have one ride, ordered by their total distance.
- Donald did not take any rides, so his distance is 0.

## Solution

### SQL Query

```sql
SELECT 
    u.name,
    IFNULL(SUM(r.distance), 0) AS travelled_distance
FROM
    Users u
LEFT JOIN
    Rides r
ON
    u.id = r.user_id
GROUP BY 
    u.id
ORDER BY 
    travelled_distance DESC, 
    u.name ASC;
```

---


### Explanation of Approach

#### 1\. **Joining the Tables**

*   You use a `LEFT JOIN` to combine the `Users` table and the `Rides` table:
    
    ```sql
    FROM Users u
    LEFT JOIN Rides r
    ON u.id = r.user_id
    ```
    
    *   The `LEFT JOIN` ensures that all users from the `Users` table are included in the result, even if they do not have any corresponding entries in the `Rides` table.
    *   If a user has no rides, the corresponding `r.distance` value will be `NULL`.

#### 2\. **Calculating the Total Distance**

*   The `SUM(r.distance)` function calculates the total distance traveled by each user.
*   To handle cases where a user has no rides, you use the `IFNULL` function:
    
    ```sql
    IFNULL(SUM(r.distance), 0) AS travelled_distance
    ```
    
    *   If `SUM(r.distance)` is `NULL` (for users with no rides), `IFNULL` replaces it with `0`.

#### 3\. **Grouping the Data**

*   The `GROUP BY u.id` clause groups the results by each user's unique ID:
    
    ```sql
    GROUP BY u.id
    ```
    
    *   This ensures that the `SUM` function calculates the total distance for each individual user.

#### 4\. **Sorting the Results**

*   The `ORDER BY` clause determines the order of the output:
    
    ```sql
    ORDER BY travelled_distance DESC, u.name ASC;
    ```
    
    *   First, users are ordered by their `travelled_distance` in descending order (highest distance first).
    *   If two or more users have the same `travelled_distance`, they are further sorted alphabetically by their `name` in ascending order.

#### 5\. **Selecting the Output**

*   The `SELECT` statement ensures the output contains the user's `name` and their total `travelled_distance`:
    
    ```sql
    SELECT u.name, IFNULL(SUM(r.distance), 0) AS travelled_distance
    ```
